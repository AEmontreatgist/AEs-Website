  <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
  <p>Welcome, this website may look like its still in development and it is but I want to keep it like this for a few reasons.<br>
    1) Not eveyone has fast internet so I want it to be very light.<br>
    2) I want it to be easy to find stuff on so it will remain primarly text if not all text.<br>
    3) I want to share information as fast as possible and large images and scripts could slow it down.<br>
    This website has also been inspired by Nick Russo and I want to follow the same design principles.<br>
